# ESDL-DSL

---

Currently the DSL can be installed by either:

- Using access token and doing pip install. #WIP
- Downloading/Cloning the repository and installing the requirements with
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  In either case it is required to also install the other DSL related packages [ESDL-DSL Middleware](https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/esdl-dsl/esdl-scenario-generator-middleware) and [ESDL-DSL Primitive Functions](https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/esdl-dsl/esdl-dsl-project).
